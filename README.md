# 🚍 SmartRide App – Sustainable, Sensor-Based Transit Innovation

### By: The Tech Team

## 📌 Overview

SmartRide is a forward-looking public transit solution designed to improve **urban mobility** by combining sensor technology, real-time data analytics, and multimodal transportation planning. The project aims to address current transit system challenges by improving **accessibility**, **sustainability**, and **user experience**.

---

## ❗ Problems in Today’s Transit Systems

* 🚫 Lack of real-time insights (bus delays, route congestion)
* 🌱 Insufficient sustainable transit alternatives (e.g., biking)
* 🧭 Poor accessibility in high-density urban zones
* 💬 Limited promotion of eco-conscious transit options

---

## 💡 Our Solution: SmartRide System

### 🛠️ Key Innovations:

#### 🔸 **Sensor-Based Bus Stops**

* Tracks **bus occupancy levels**
* Monitors **air quality**
* Detects **road conditions**
* Provides **live bus schedules**
* Collects data on **peak traffic hours**

#### 🔸 **Smart Stop Technology**

* Only users **within a set proximity radius** can trigger a stop request
* Prevents misuse or miscommunication in crowded transit zones

#### 🔸 **Integrated Bike Ride Features**

* Expand bike lanes in:

  * Densely populated regions
  * Low-air-quality zones
  * Areas with inconvenient bus access
  * Terminals to enable seamless multimodal travel

## 🌎 Inspired by SOBI’s Success

The SmartRide App takes cues from the success of **SOBI (Social Bicycles)** and adapts it to Brampton’s transit system to promote:

* Better last-mile connectivity
* Eco-conscious commuting options
* Community-wide health and mobility improvements
